                <p>My name is Warren Moore. I am currently studying a Diploma of Software Development at TAFE in Petersham. I am using udemy courses to supplement my study as at Granville TAFE I missed out on Javascript and React. I hope within the next 6 to 8 months to be working as a software developer and maybe even attending university for a Bachelor in Computer Science.</p></td>
